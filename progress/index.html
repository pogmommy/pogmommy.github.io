		<h1>Progress</h1>
		<h2>June 5, 2017</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			Updated nav bar, updated iOS beta page, etc. General redesign.
		</p>

			You know what really turns me on? This sleek, beautiful website structure. I've now got a folder for fonts, images, CSS (which I should have had from the beginning), and I'm just about to make one for downloadable files. I formatted the code, properly linked files, got rid of console errors. Wow. This really feels great.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>February 6, 2017</h2>
		<br>
		<p>
			Don't worry! it hasn't been a year. I just haven't updated this page in a year. I have edited the site though. Reformatting the layout, page strucutre, and I really need to revise my messy code. I've added and removed content and have actually been really been making improvements recently. I removed my blog, because I dont use it. I added a game, replaced the "iOS" tab with a "Projects" tab, removed some content that just didn't belong on the page, and more stuff like that. Hell, it's been so long I forgot to mention that I have found a way to host the site. Github, obiously.

		<p>
			This is harder than it looks. I've been trying forever to find a decent FTP server to host this on, for free. In fact, at time of writing, I don't have a working domain.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			I'm using a VPN at school to connect my phone to my FTP server, to connect to my dropbox, which currently contains my website files.
		</p>
		<p>
			It isn't going very well.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			anyway, back to about me.
		<p/>
		<p>
			actually, I could create a subdomain here with all the excess info. It wouldn't be a bad idea.
		</p>
		<p>
			before I do that, I'm going to make a banner at the top of the screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			There we go. It looks like crap, but oh well.
		</p>
		<h2>February 5, 2016</h2>
		<p>
			Fixed it. It's now locked to the top of the screen, which would be nice if I actually had enough content to scroll.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've also added a webpage view tracker.
		<p>
		<p>
			As of now, I'm already at 83 views from myself.
		</p>
		<h2>April 22, 2016</h2>
		<p>
			It's ben about half a month since I last worked on the site. I seriously need to find a remote server-
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a freaking idiot
		</p>
		<p>
			I've been using Github for some other projects, and never even considered using it for this.
		</p>
		<p>
			Why must I be like this?
		</p>

		<p>
			IT IS ONLINE! It may not be public as of today, but it sure is online. Obviosuly, it is on GitHub. Works great. Fixed a bunch of bugs, cleaned up code and directories, etc. I am so happy right now! IT'S UP!
		</p>
		<h2>May 4, 2016</h2>
		<p>
			Well, It's here, and rapidly getting improvements. I am super proud of this.
