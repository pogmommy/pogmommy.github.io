<h1>Below are listed my projects</h1>
<h2>My goal is to make them all open source</h2>
<h3><a href="https://thegodhead.github.io"></a>The GodHead</h3>
<p>I won't delve into this project here. Just take a look.</p>

<a href="../ios/"><img src="../images/ios.png" alt="iOS Logo" style="width:10%"></a>
<p> I have several projects regarding iOS, which are listed on my iOS page </p>

<p>If you wanna play a Super Mario 63 mirror, you can find it <a href="https://mpg13.github.io/sm63/">Here</a>.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p> Click <a href="../js-game/">here</a> to play a simple Javascript game. It's not much, but it was just for a web design class in school. I expect better to come.

<p> I have also worked with a colleague who goes by <a href="https://github.com/OreoKing21">OreoKing21</a> to make <a href="https://github.com/MPG13/QuantumEntanglement-SpeedSystems">QuantumEntanglement-SpeedSystems</a>. Faster than Lightspeed-Systems. OreoKing was the developer behind the project, and I polished it up. </p>

<br>
<p> There's also a <a href="../mpgsearch/">customized search engine</a>, which is probably my most pointless project yet. </p>
