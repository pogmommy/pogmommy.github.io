Code still needs refinement, but for the most part it's adequete enough for me.

This is my GitHub. Ive got a bit of stuff. Some of it is for personal use and anyone who might want it. Such as mirrors for pebble apps, as the pebble store is likely going down soon. I use it for file storage on occasion. Forking projects and just screwing around with stuff when I've got no clue what I'm doing.
