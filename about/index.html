	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>This is where I talk about myself</h2>
	<p>I am a  highschool graduate in Idaho, United States. The majority of my high school career was focused around computer applications and similar classes, such as compsci, web design, and Broadcasting, where I spent my senior year as a director. I also went to California to compete nationally in Business Professionals of America.</p>
	<p>I've worked professionally in IT and mobile and computer repairs, including screens, batteries, hard drives, etc, and I love programming and computer science.</p>
	<p>I have made a handful of projects, between websites and iOS utilities. I host my own Cydia repo, and have iOS programming experience including tweak development and iOS Application development. I have made themes for iOS, but I'm no artist.</p>
	<p>I love Jailbreaking, and have for years. In the last few years, I have worked to make a name for myself in the jailbreak community, and have a number of large projects including FlashBack and UnderTime, both of which you can read more about from the Projects tab. I have jailbroken iOS 4-12 at this point, and have accumulated an arsenal of Apple Devices, some dating as far back as from pre-iPods.</p>
	<p>My daily devices range across most major operating systems. My Desktop runs Windows with the Linux Subsystem, and my MacBook runs both macOS and Windows. I am familiar with the general ins and outs of all the mentioned systems.</p>
	<p>I also casually game, and own some of the best Nintendo consoles (N64, Switch, Wii, Gamecube, NDSi, 2DS). I also play some PC games, my favorite being the Portal series. My all-time favorite games, however, are Super Mario 64 (N64) and Animal Crossing New Leaf (3DS).</p>
