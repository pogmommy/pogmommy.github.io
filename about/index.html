	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<h2>This is where I talk about myself</h2>
	<p>I am a Senior in highschool in Idaho, United States. I'm in the broadcasting club in my school, and have taken both the Computer Science and Web Design classes as far as they are offered. I've worked professionally in mobile and computer repairs, including screens, batteries, hard drives, etc. I love programming and computer science, and find myself to be proficient at Web Design. I am working to become fluent in Objective-C.</p>
	<p>I have made a handful of projects, most being websites which are never used. I host my own Cydia repo, and I have other iOS programming experience including tweak development and iOS Application development. I have made themes for iOS, but I'm no artist.</p>
	<p>I love Jailbreaking, and have ever since I started in late 2013 on my iPod Touch. In the last few years, I have worked to make a name for myself in the jailbreak community, and have a number of large projects including FlashBack and UnderTime, both of which you can read more about from the Projects tab. I have jailbroken iOS 4-12 at this point, and have accumulated an arsenal of Apple Devices, some dating as far back as from 1998.</p>
	<p>My daily devices range across most major operating systems. My Desktop runs Windows with the Linux Subsystem, and my MacBook runs both macOS and Windows. I am familiar with the general ins and outs of all the mentioned systems.</p>
	<p>I also casually game, and own some of the best Nintendo consoles (N64, Switch, Wii, Gamecube, NDSi, 2DS). I also play some PC games, my favorite being the Portal series. My all-time favorite games, however, are Super Mario 64 (N64) and Animal Crossing New Leaf (3DS).</p>
