	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a Senior in highschool in Idaho, United States. I'm in the broadcasting club in my school, and have taken both the Computer Science and Web Design classes as far as they are offered. I love programming and computer science, and find myself to be proficient at Web Design. I am working to become fluent in Objective-C.</p>
	<p>I have made a handful of projects, most being websites which are never used. I have made a simple iOS app, and host my own Cydia repo. I have made themes for iOS, but I'm no artist.</p>
	<p>I love Jailbreaking, and have ever since I started in late 2013 on my iPod Touch. I have jailbroken iOS 4-12 at this point, and have accumulated an arsenal of Apple Devices, some dating as far back as 1998.</p>
	<p>My daily devices range across most major operating systems. My Desktop runs Windows with the Linux Subsystem, and my MacBook runs both macOS and Windows. I am familiar with the ins and outs of all the mentioned systems.</p>
