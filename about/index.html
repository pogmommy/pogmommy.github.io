	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>I am a Junior in highschool in Idaho, United States. I'm in the broadcasting club in my school, and have taken both the Computer Science and Web Design classes as far as they are offered. I love programming and computer science, and find myself to be proficient at Web Design. I am working to become fluent in Swift and Objective-C as well.</p>
	<p>I have made a handful of projects, most being websites which are never used. I have made a simple iOS app, and host my own Cydia repo. I have made themes for iOS, but I'm no artist.</p>
	<p>I love Jailbreaking, and always have since I started in late 2013 on my iPod running iOS 6.1.3. I have jailbroken iOS 4-11 at this point, and have accumulated an arsenal of Apple Devices, including an iPhone 3GS, an iPad, an iPhone 4, two iPod touch 4s, an iPhone 5c, an iPad mini, an iPhone 6, and the device I am proudest of: an iMac G3.</p>
	<p>My daily devices range across most major operating systems. My Desktop and Laptop are both dualbooting Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04. I have an iMac Running Mojave, and as aforementioned, an iMac G3, running Mac OS X 10.3 Panther.</p>
