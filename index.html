			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				I'm <span style="opacity:0.5"><strike>14</strike></span> <strike>15</strike> 16 years old, and enjoy computers. My first tool for learning about computers was an iPod Touch, 4th generation. I was homeschooled in 7th grade, and guess what? That's really where this story begins. So I basically spent eight months on a computer. That was when I hit my all-time low, which I believe contributed to me hitting my all-time high. As I did my school work, I would often tinker around with my iPod. I found some ways to impliment "Jailbreak tweaks" into it, despite it being "jailed".
			</p>
			<p>
				I eventually jailbroke it, which ended up giving me an interest in coding. I changed how it looked, and even made it appear to run iOS 7, even though that model only goes to iOS 6.1.6.
			</p>
			<p>
				I learned that I am excellent at manipulating my resources. I am poor at intense coding and programming, and hardware is easy up until you get to putting it all on a circuit board.
			<p>
			<p>
				Of course, spending a year away from people, I lost vital social skills. Regardless, I built my way back up, and right now, my life is exceptional.

				Actually, I removed the blog page.
