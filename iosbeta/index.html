			So, you want to know about the beta? Well, here's my take on it.

		<h2>iOS 10: Beta 3-7 [#3]<span style="font-size:x-small"> August 22, 2016</span></h2>
		<p>
			Wow, I missed four updates.
		</p>
		<p>
			Within the last several betas, not much has changed. We've gotten new keyboard click sounds, and a new lock sound. The new iOS 10 animations have been removed, and touch ID has been sped up.
		</p>
		<p>
			Beta 6 fixed devices possibly panicking when using a smart battery case, and beta 7 was standalone, meaning the applewatch, macOS, and other systems did not recieve companion betas, as they often do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Really not much to go over, but I feel like we are getting very close to a Gold Master. I think iOS 10 public release may be soon.
		</p>
		<h2>iOS 10: Beta 2 [#2]<span style="font-size:x-small"> July 5, 2016</span></h2>
		<p>
			Alright, let's get to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, lets talk bugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			And that's about it for bugs!
		</p>
		<p>
			Just kidding. Most users have near none, though for me the widgets don't seem to be loading. That bug existed before though, so i may just be able to write that off to the devs of the widgets.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is another bug, It's that your iPhone 6s may panic if ued with the Apple Charger case. Cool.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now onto new features/design.
		</p>
	</center>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Passcode dots are slightly smaller on lockscreen.
			</li>
			<li>
				Folder animation changed slightly, also there is a new blur effect behind the folder when it grows.
			</li>

		<h2>iOS 10: Beta 1 [#1]<span style="font-size:x-small"> June 14, 2016</span></h2>
		<p>
			I've noticed that this version of iOS 10 is very stable for a first beta. It lacks some features covered in WWDC, but that's to be expected. It does, however, have new animations, new graphics, and new features.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's start with Animations. When you open/close an app, the app scrren shrinks quickly and turns into the icon, with a slightly bouncier effect. Folders grow, rather than zooming, meaning that your wallpaper isn't cropped in folder view. Bubbles in messages also have a more "bubbly" feel, by experiencing velocity. There isn't much else, but if I see anything, I'll update you guys here.
		</p>
		<p>
			Next is Graphics. iOS 10 came with a large overhaul. The icons and general UI remained the same, but things such as the Notification center and notifications changed drastically. The notifications are no longer squared, but are now rounded, and have a white background, rather than transparent. Banner notifications float down, and remain at the top of your screen until interacted with or another notification inturrupts it. The notification center widgets have the ame style, and are all a set size, regardless of what the developer defined.
		</p>
		<p>
			As with any major iOS update, we recieved new features. Some of these included:
		</p>
	</center>
	<left>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Individual read reciepts: Select which contacts will know when you've read their messages.
			</li>
			<li>
				Fun messaging: iMesage has been given a lot of controversial features. These include drawings, live drawings (from the ï£¿Watch), stickers, and bubble effects. When you press and hold the "send" button, a menu pops up, and you can choose an animation to affect the bubble when the recipient recieves the message. The effects include:
			</li>
			<li>
				SLAM: where the bubble seemingly falls violently into the conversation.
			</li>
			<li>
				LOUD: where the bubble gives off a screaming effect by shaking violently.
			</li>
			<li>
				SOFT: where the bubble gently make it's way into the conversation, and the text slowly grows to accomodate the bubble size.
			</li>
			<li>
				INVISIBLE INK: The bubble's contents are scrambled, and a you slide your finger over the bubble, the mesage is revealed.
			</li>
			<li>
				Opening up to Devs: Siri and iMessage has been opened up to developers, allowing us to use siri to automate more functions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Notification Spoltight: Spotlight can now be found in the notification center, as well as it's original location on the home screen, by pulling the page down.
			</li>
			<li>
				Widget Screen: Notification Center widgets can now be seen from where the spotlight page once was.
			</li>
			<li>
				Lockscreen Widgets: Notification Center widgets can now be seen by swiping to the left on the lock screen, as well as a camera to the right.
			</li>
			<li>
				press to unlock: Instead of the "swipe to unlock" that we have known for the entire iPhone era, iOS 10 now features a "Press home to unlock". Pressing the Home button now brings up the passcode view, or unlocks the device if no pascode is present.
			</li>
		</ul>

	<p>
		Lastly, bugs. There aren't as many bugs as you'd expect in iOS 10, for a first beta, but theose I have found include quick reply UI error, rare random reboots, on occasion, nav bar items will clone and overlap, and fixed NC widget sizes.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's all I've got right now, but I'll keep this page updated with more.
